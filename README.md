## Node.js
The server must correctly handle the file uploads. For this, you need middleware to process multipart/form-data. Below is an example using Node.js with Express and the multer library.
1. Install Required Packages:
- for installing package.json, type command: npm init -y
- for installing package-lock.json, type command: npm install express multer

package.json defines your project's dependencies.
package-lock.json ensures consistency and stability when installing those dependencies.
